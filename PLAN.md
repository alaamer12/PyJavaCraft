# 🧩 Jython Collaboration Learning Path: Python + Java Integration

**Participants:**

* **Amr Muhamed** (Python lover)
* **Friend** (Java enthusiast)

**Goal:** Learn how to build hybrid apps using **Jython**, progressing through increasing levels of complexity. Each level will have specific learning goals, responsibilities, tools, and deliverables.

---

## 🌱 Level 1 – Beginner: Console-Based Todo App

### 🎯 Objective:

Get hands-on with basic Jython features by building a console todo-list app. Learn how to:

* Call Java from Python
* Use Java classes in Python scripts

### 🧱 Architecture:

* **Java:** Data model + logic
* **Python:** CLI interface

### 👨‍💻 Java Developer Tasks:

* Implement `Task` class (id, title, completed flag)
* Implement `TaskManager` class with methods:

  * `addTask(title)`
  * `deleteTask(id)`
  * `listTasks()`

### 🐍 Python Developer Tasks:

* Create CLI loop (`input()`-based)
* Call Java logic via Jython
* Map user commands to Java methods

---

## 🌿 Level 2 – Intermediate: File Storage + UI

### 🎯 Objective:

Build a hybrid GUI-based app. Use JavaFX for UI and Python for logic (e.g., validation, filtering).

### 🧱 Architecture:

* **Java:** GUI (JavaFX), file I/O
* **Python:** Business logic (e.g., filter done tasks)

### 👨‍💻 Java Developer Tasks:

* Build JavaFX UI
* Handle loading/saving tasks to a file (e.g., JSON or CSV)
* Use `PythonInterpreter` to run Python logic on tasks

### 🐍 Python Developer Tasks:

* Create `filter.py` to remove completed tasks
* Validate user input and normalize data

---

## 🌳 Level 3 – Advanced: Notes App with Plugin System

### 🎯 Objective:

Introduce modularity and extensibility via a plugin system powered by Python.

### 🧱 Architecture:

* **Java:** App core + plugin loader
* **Python:** User-defined plugins

### 👨‍💻 Java Developer Tasks:

* Define plugin interface
* Load `.py` files and call plugin functions
* Build plugin manager

### 🐍 Python Developer Tasks:

* Implement plugins:

  * `auto_tag.py`: Adds tags based on note content
  * `summarizer.py`: Summarizes long notes
  * `sort_notes.py`: Sorts notes

---

## 🌲 Level 4 – Expert: Hybrid SDK Template

### 🎯 Objective:

Create a reusable app template or SDK for building hybrid apps with Java backbones and Python plugins.

### Features:

* GUI scaffold in JavaFX
* Plugin registration and execution
* Custom event hooks
* Python user scripts for automation or customization

### 🧱 Architecture:

* **Java:** Defines system, lifecycle, UI
* **Python:** Defines plugins, logic, customization

### Deliverables:

* SDK with documentation
* Sample app that uses SDK
* How-to-write-plugin guide

## 🌲 Level 5 – Expert+: Finance Tracker with MVC, DB, and Optimization

### 🎯 Objective:

Build a serious, professional-grade hybrid app with full architecture, performance, and design patterns.

### 🏗️ Project: Hybrid Finance Tracker (HFT)

Tracks incomes, expenses, budgets, generates reports, and does budget analysis.

### 🧱 Architecture:

* **Java:**

  * MVC structure
  * Database access (JDBC + PostgreSQL or SQLite)
  * JavaFX UI
  * Plugin manager (calls Python logic)
* **Python:**

  * Plugins (e.g., budget forecast, risk analyzer)
  * NumPy for optimized calculations
  * Custom reports (PDF/CSV)

### Design Patterns Used:

* MVC
* Strategy
* Observer
* Factory
* Bridge

### 👨‍💻 Java Developer Tasks:

* Define `User`, `Transaction`, `Budget` models
* Create JavaFX UI (input, charts, dashboards)
* Manage JDBC connection to a database
* Bridge to Python plugins

### 🐍 Python Developer Tasks:

* Forecast monthly budgets using historical data
* Analyze category spending using NumPy
* Generate custom reports (PDF, CSV)
* Add Python plugins to detect anomalies or trends

### Database Setup:

* Schema defined in SQL
* Data persisted via Java JDBC
* Data passed to Python as Java objects

### Reporting Engine:

* Create reports using Python libraries
* Export via CSV or PDF
* Triggered from UI or batch mode
