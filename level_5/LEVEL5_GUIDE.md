# 📘 LEVEL 5 GUIDE – Enterprise-Style System with MVC, Database & Optimization

## 🎯 Goal

Develop a full-featured, enterprise-style task management system. Incorporate:

* MVC Architecture
* Persistent storage (SQL DB)
* User authentication (optional)
* Performance optimization in task computations
* Clean modular design

---

## 👥 Responsibilities

### 🧠 Java Developer (Your Friend)

* **Java Server Upgrade**:

  * Refactor using **MVC pattern**
  * Add **database integration** using JDBC or ORM (Hibernate optional)
  * Enhance protocol (support `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `FILTER`, etc.)
  * Secure the server (input validation, optional auth)
* **Advanced JavaFX GUI**:

  * Full MVC design
  * Support filtering, sorting, priority, due dates
  * Visual stats dashboard (chart API)

### 🐍 Python Developer (You)

* **CLI Refactor**:

  * Follow CLI MVC-like separation (commands/controllers/views)
  * Support advanced task filtering/sorting via user input
* **Backend Integration**:

  * Implement a lightweight ORM or raw SQL client for debugging
  * Build task optimizer module:

    * Prioritize based on due date, workload, etc.
    * Optimize task schedules for user efficiency
* (Optional) Web client using Flask + Jinja or Typer + Rich

## 🧩 Key Features to Implement

* Add/Edit/Delete tasks
* Assign task to users (multi-user mode)
* Filter by user, date, priority
* Dashboard showing stats (completed/active tasks)
* Use of indexes and efficient queries (DB side)
* Graceful error handling, logging, validation

---

## 📈 Optimization Module (Python)

Create `optimizer.py` with features like:

* Auto-sort tasks by priority & deadline
* Recommend next task based on historical completion time
* Suggest weekly schedule for balanced workload

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

* MVC architecture is respected
* Tasks persist across server restarts
* Both clients operate on the same DB via the server
* Optimizer module produces meaningful output
* Project can be demonstrated like a small SaaS system

---

## 🧠 Tips

* Use SQLite (easy) or PostgreSQL (realistic)
* Model shared schema between Python and Java
* Add unit tests for controllers and models
* Consider admin panel or web dashboard (optional)

---

## 🚦 Project Completion When...

* You both understand and apply MVC
* Full DB integration is in place
* Optimization logic works and is testable
* Python CLI and Java GUI both operate on the enterprise backend

---

## 🏁 Endgame Bonus Ideas

* Web dashboard
* Role-based access (admin/user)
* Dockerize the full app
* REST API gateway (Java or Python)
